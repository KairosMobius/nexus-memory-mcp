## Tweet 1 (Hook)

Your AI agents are goldfish.

Every session starts from zero. Every decision re-explained. Every preference forgotten.

We fixed this. One npm package. Your agents remember everything now.

Thread on what we built and why it matters:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)

We run 9 AI agents in production. Every night they coordinate: research, writing, code review, clinical validation.

The #1 problem? Context loss.

Agent A learns something critical at 11pm. Agent B starts fresh at 6am and has no idea.

Multiply that across every developer using Agent Teams.

## Tweet 3 (The Solution)

Memory Nexus: an MCP server that gives any Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf agent persistent memory.

Not keyword matching. Four layers working together:
- Semantic search (find by meaning)
- Knowledge graph (how ideas connect)
- Temporal awareness (when you learned it)
- Pattern detection (what keeps coming up)

## Tweet 4 (The Differentiator)

Two features nobody else has:

1. **Awaken/Hibernate** - Your agent starts each session by restoring its full identity. What it was working on, what it learned, what comes next. This is agent self-continuity.

2. **Intelligence Packs** - Pre-built domain expertise. Load 100+ verified memories and your agent is instantly a DevOps expert, security auditor, or Python specialist.

## Tweet 5 (Team Memory)

For Agent Teams, it gets better.

Shared memory: what the team knows collectively.
Private memory: what each agent knows individually.

Agent A discovers a critical bug pattern. It goes to shared memory. Agent B picks it up automatically on its next recall.

No copy-pasting. No re-explaining. The team learns as a unit.

---

## Tweet 6 (Proof / Credibility)

This isn't theoretical. We've been running awaken/hibernate cycles on our own 9-agent system for weeks.

Our agents have accumulated 500+ memories. They know our architecture decisions, our deploy patterns, our coding preferences, our blockers.

They pick up where they left off. Every time.
