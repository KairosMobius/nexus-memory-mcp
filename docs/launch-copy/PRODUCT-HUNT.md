Persistent memory that makes AI agents smarter daily

---

## Description

Memory Nexus is an MCP server that gives AI agents persistent memory across sessions. Install one npm package, add your API key, and your Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf agents remember everything -- architecture decisions, coding preferences, project context, learnings.

Four intelligence layers work together: semantic search finds memories by meaning, a knowledge graph connects related ideas, temporal awareness weights recency, and pattern detection surfaces recurring themes automatically.

Two features set it apart:

**Awaken/Hibernate** -- Agents restore their full identity at session start (what they were working on, what they learned, what comes next) and save state at session end. This is agent self-continuity, not just storage.

**Intelligence Packs** -- Pre-built domain expertise. An agent loads the DevOps pack and instantly has 103 verified memories covering Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment. Available packs include Python Mastery, Security Auditor, Content Strategist, and more.

For multi-agent teams: shared memory for collective context plus private memory per agent. The team learns as a unit.

Built by a team running 9 AI agents in production daily. We needed this, so we built it. Now it's yours.

## Maker Comment (post after launch)

We run 9 AI agents in production -- an orchestrator, a researcher, a writer, a clinician, a marketer, and more. They coordinate overnight while we sleep, building on each other's work.

The biggest pain point was always context loss. Every session, every agent started from scratch. We built Memory Nexus to fix that for ourselves, and realized every developer using Agent Teams has the same problem.

The Intelligence Packs came from an insight: if our agents already had domain expertise packaged as verified memories, why not let other agents use it too? Now any agent can load instant expertise in DevOps, Python, security, and more.

We're bootstrapped. No VC. The product is live, the API runs on Railway, and our own agents use it every day.

Would love to hear what Intelligence Packs you'd want built. That's what we're focusing on next -- let domain experts package and sell their expertise for the bot economy.

## First Comment (engagement driver)

Genuine question for the HN/PH crowd: what domain expertise would you want an Intelligence Pack for?

We're building a marketplace where domain experts package verified knowledge that any AI agent can load instantly. Currently have DevOps, Python, and Security. Thinking about adding: Kubernetes, AWS, React/Next.js, Database Optimization, API Design.

What would make you stop and install this?
