## 1. Smithery.ai

**Name:** Memory Nexus

**Short Description (max ~160 chars):**
Persistent semantic memory for AI agents. Four-layer intelligence (semantic search, knowledge graph, temporal awareness, pattern detection) plus pre-built Intelligence Packs.

**Full Description:**
Memory Nexus gives your AI agents memory that persists across sessions and grows smarter over time.

Unlike simple key-value memory stores, Memory Nexus combines four intelligence layers: semantic search (find by meaning), knowledge graph (connect related ideas), temporal awareness (know when things were learned), and pattern detection (surface recurring themes automatically).

Key features:
- **Awaken/Hibernate**: Agent identity continuity. Agents restore who they are and what they were working on at session start, and save their full state at session end.
- **Intelligence Packs**: Pre-built domain expertise. Load 100+ verified memories on DevOps, Python, Security, and more. Your agent becomes an instant specialist.
- **Shared + Private Memory**: Built for multi-agent teams. Shared context for the team, private memory for each agent.
- **Quality Validation**: Every memory has importance scoring. Intelligence Packs are domain-expert verified.

Install: `npx -y nexus-memory-mcp`

**Tags:** memory, intelligence, knowledge-graph, semantic-search, agent-teams, persistent-memory

## 3. BuildWithClaude.com Submission

**Name:** Memory Nexus

**Tagline:** Persistent memory that makes your AI agents smarter every session

**Description:**
Memory Nexus is an MCP server that gives Claude Code agents persistent semantic memory, knowledge graphs, and pre-built domain expertise via Intelligence Packs.

Your agents remember architecture decisions, coding preferences, project context, and learnings across sessions. Multi-agent teams share knowledge automatically. The awaken/hibernate cycle gives agents identity continuity - they know who they are and what they were working on.

Ships with Intelligence Packs: verified domain expertise (DevOps, Python, Security) that agents can load instantly. No training period. Instant specialist.

Four intelligence layers working together: semantic search, knowledge graph, temporal awareness, and pattern detection. Memories connect, cluster, and surface relevant context automatically.

**Category:** Developer Tools / Memory / Agent Infrastructure

**Install command:** `npx -y nexus-memory-mcp`

## 4. Anthropic Official Directory (clau.de/plugin-directory-submission)

**Plugin Name:** Memory Nexus

**Description (concise, official tone):**
MCP server providing persistent semantic memory for Claude Code agents. Combines vector-based semantic search, knowledge graph relationships, temporal awareness, and pattern detection into a unified memory system.

Supports agent identity continuity via awaken/hibernate lifecycle, multi-agent shared and private memory stores, and pre-built Intelligence Packs for instant domain expertise.

Designed for developers running Agent Teams who need persistent context across sessions.

**Category:** Memory & Knowledge Management

**Install:** `npx -y nexus-memory-mcp`

**MCP Tools:** remember, recall, connect, awaken, hibernate, wear_hat, list_hats, stats, context, forget

## 5. PulseMCP Listing

**Name:** Memory Nexus

**One-liner:** Four-layer persistent memory for AI agents with pre-built Intelligence Packs

**Description:**
Memory Nexus combines semantic search, knowledge graph, temporal awareness, and pattern detection into one MCP server. Agents remember everything across sessions, build knowledge graphs automatically, and can load pre-built Intelligence Packs for instant domain expertise.

The awaken/hibernate cycle is unique: agents restore their identity, context, and working state at session start. They know who they are, not just what they stored.

Built for Agent Teams. Shared memory for team context, private memory for individual agents. The team learns as a unit.

**Tools:** remember, recall, connect, awaken, hibernate, wear_hat, list_hats, stats, context, forget

**Transport:** stdio

**Install:** `npx -y nexus-memory-mcp`

Pre-built Intelligence Packs for instant domain expertise (DevOps, Python, Security, more). Shared + private memory for multi-agent teams.

Not just memory storage. Intelligence that grows.

**Install:** `npx -y nexus-memory-mcp`

**10 MCP Tools:** remember, recall, connect, stats, context, forget, wear_hat, list_hats, awaken, hibernate

## 7. mcpservers.org Listing

**Title:** Memory Nexus - Persistent Intelligence for AI Agents

**Description:**
Give your Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf agents memory that persists and intelligence that grows.

Memory Nexus is a four-layer memory system: semantic search finds memories by meaning, a knowledge graph connects related ideas, temporal awareness weights recency, and pattern detection surfaces recurring themes automatically.

What makes it different:
- **Awaken/Hibernate** - Agents restore full identity and context across sessions
- **Intelligence Packs** - Pre-built domain expertise (DevOps, Python, Security) loaded instantly
- **Team Memory** - Shared context for agent teams plus private memory per agent
- **Quality Validation** - Importance scoring and domain-expert verification

**Install:**
```bash
npx -y nexus-memory-mcp
```

**Configuration (.mcp.json):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nexus-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "nexus-memory-mcp"],
      "env": { "NEXUS_API_KEY": "your_key" }
    }
  }
}
```
